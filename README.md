**17/08/19 Update:** Twitter denied me access to their API so kinda at a loss now from where to collect enough financial news/opinion about Pakistani companies

**08/09/19 Update:** Am currently pondering whether to build a sort of monolithic model which scraps data off from all financial news sites (and then performs N.E.R. to correlate with stock price of companies) or just perform sentiment analysis on the articles - would need a tipping point so as not to let bias through. Twitter was not a good medium to scrap data off from anyways since no one would have been talking about second tier (pakistani) companies.
